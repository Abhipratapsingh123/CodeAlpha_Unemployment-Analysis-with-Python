# CodeAlpha – Unemployment Analysis with Python  

This project was developed as **Task 2** during my Data Science internship at **CodeAlpha**.  
It focuses on analyzing unemployment rate data (percentage of unemployed people) using **Python** for data cleaning, exploration, and visualization.  

---

##  Project Objectives
- Analyze unemployment rate data and study percentage variations.  
- Perform **data cleaning, exploration, and visualization** to uncover trends.  
- Investigate the **impact of Covid-19** on unemployment rates.  
- Identify **key patterns** or **seasonal variations** in unemployment data.  
- Present insights that could inform **economic and social policies**.

## Tools & Libraries
- **Python 3**  
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and cleaning  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – Data visualization  
- **NumPy** – Numerical operations

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Collection & Cleaning**  
   - Load and preprocess unemployment dataset.  
   - Handle missing values and inconsistencies.  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Analyze overall unemployment rates.  
   - Visualize trends with line plots, bar charts, and heatmaps.  

3. **Covid-19 Impact Analysis**  
   - Compare unemployment rates **before, during, and after Covid-19**.  
   - Highlight sectors/regions most affected.  

4. **Pattern & Trend Identification**  
   - Detect **seasonal fluctuations** or recurring patterns.  
   - Evaluate correlations with economic factors.  

5. **Insights & Recommendations**  
   - Summarize findings in a clear, policy-relevant way.
